# PlotScripts
 These scripts are for simple plotting of data. It uses the holoviews plotting libraries for plotting

 # How to use
 First you need to install a Anaconda python 3.x version on your computer. After doing that you can install the conda envrionement by.

 ```python
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Now it should be possible to run the scripts. This you can do by:

```python
python myplot.py --config <pathtoConfigfile>
```

This should initiate the plotting script and when finished, should reward you with a nice html plot.

There are several possible args you can pass,

| Arg       | Type           | mandatory  | description |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| --config, --file, --c, --conf      | path/str | yes | The path to the config file |
| --show    | bool      |   no | If False the script will not show any html plots, default is True |
| --save, --s | bool     |    no | Bool if you want to save the plots or not, default is True |

# The Config file
In order to plot anything you need to have a Config file. These files are YAML styled files. Some examples can be found in the CONFIGS folder.
In principle such a file looks like this:

<pre>
---
  Files: # The files which are plotted together
    - MyMeasurementfilePath.txt

  Filetype: ASCII # What kind of type is my file, other options are json or yml

  Output: myplot #Output folder path for my plots

  Save_as: # save the plots in different data formats, if more than one is specified all of them will be plotted
    - html
    - png
    - svg

  Analysis:
    - myAnalysisPlugin # The analysis Plugin over which the data will be run. These plugins must be located in the foler "analysis_scripts"

  Poolsize: 4 # Maximum pool size of simultaneous analysis scripts

  # Optional Parameters
  ASCII_file_specs: # The specifications for the ascii file type measurements files
    header_lines: 8
    measurement_description: 9
    units_line: 9
    data_start: 10

  # Options for the different Analyses scripts
  # These options are entirely up to you and what you need in your analysis
  myAnalysisPlugin:  This must match at least one of your measurement analysis plugins
      General: # Options common to all plots
          fontsize: {'title': 28, 'labels': 24, 'xticks': 24, 'yticks': 24, 'legend': 11}

      Layout: # these must the the names of the methods understood by holoviews!!! and a valid parameters
          cols: 2 # How many columns there are in the final output plot

      DoSpecialPlots: # Whether or not to do the SpecialPlot, it may not succeed if not at least one measurement has this special plot stated
          - BoxWhisker
          - Violin
          - concatHistogram
          - Histogram

      # Options for SpecialPlots, the suffix must always be "Options"

          shared_axes: False
          box_alpha: 0.3
          width: 1200
          height: 900

</pre>


# The measurements files
If you have json or YAML files you do not need specila treatment here, just state it correctly in the config file.

If you have ASCII styled files you need to include the parameters

<pre>
ASCII_file_specs: # The specifications for the ascii file type measurements files
  header_lines: 8
  measurement_description: 9
  units_line: 9
  data_start: 10
</pre>

in you config file. THe subparamerts:

+ header_lines defines the length of the header in lines.
+ measurement_description the line with the name of the measurements
+ units_line the line where the units a described (can be the same line as measurement_description) the only thing this line need to have is something like curr [A], curr[A] or something like this, so the cript can find the units
+ data_start is the starting line of the data, which can be separated by tabs, whitespace or commas

If you follow this rules the script should be able to interpret your data.


# The measurement plugins
The measurement plugins located in the analysis_scripts folder need to be python classes.
Form the main they are getting passed the data, and the config dictionaries

1) The data dict:
This dictionary is containing all the data from the files with the key beeing the base name of the files from the config.
Inside each entry is again a dictionary with the keys:

+ data - a Dict with all measurements and each entry containing a ndarray with the data
+ header - a list of str containing the header from the file
+ measurements - a list of all measurements, in the order of the input file
+ units - a list containinf all units fot each measurement
+ analysed - a bool value (for your use)
+ plots - a bool value (for your use)

2) The configs dict:
This dictionary is a 1 to 1 representation of your config file


## The basic structure of analysis plugins
In principle you can do whatever you want from this point on, but I have written some cool tools for plotting which will help you create some cool plots in no time with little effort.
The structure I am plotting is as follows:

<pre>
class IVCV:

    def __init__(self, data, configs):

        self.log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        self.data = convert_to_df(data, abs=True) # Converts the data to pandas dataframes, and the optional parameter "abs" will return only the abs value for each measurement.
        self.config = configs
        self.df = []
        self.basePlots = None
        self.PlotDict = {}

        # Convert the units to the desired ones
        for meas in self.measurements:
            unit = self.config["IVCV_QTC"].get(meas, {}).get("UnitConversion", None)
            if unit:
                self.data = convert_to_EngUnits(self.data, meas, unit)

        hv.renderer('bokeh')

    def run(self):
        """Runs the script"""

        # Plot all Measurements
        self.basePlots = plot_all_measurements(self.data, self.config, "voltage", "IVCV_QTC", do_not_plot=("voltage"))
        self.PlotDict["BasePlots"] = self.basePlots
        self.PlotDict["All"] = self.basePlots

        # Whiskers Plot
        self.WhiskerPlots = dospecialPlots(self.data, self.config, "IVCV_QTC", "BoxWhisker", self.measurements)
        if self.WhiskerPlots:
            self.PlotDict["Whiskers"] = self.WhiskerPlots
            self.PlotDict["All"] = self.PlotDict["All"] + self.WhiskerPlots # This is how you add plots together in holoviews

        # Reconfig the plots to be sure
        self.PlotDict["All"] = config_layout(self.PlotDict["All"], **self.config["IVCV_QTC"].get("Layout", {}))
        return self.PlotDict

</pre>**

As a return the framework wants a least a dictionary with the entry "All", in which all plots are combined, if this is not there, no plots will be shown and saving cannot be done.


# Tools and other things

The framework has lots of subroutines which can simplify your workflow. These are located
in the folders "forge". It tried to give every function a Docstring but sometimes I am lacy but you will figure out what it does.

The utilities script gives you some basic non plot specific functions, normally you will not need them
The tools script gives you tools how to plot or manipulate data
The specialPlots script includes all special plot scripts, like violin, Histogram etc. you can add some as well


The most important functions are:
+ forge.tools.plot_all_measurements - These function plots you all measurements
+ forge.tools.convert_to_EngUnits - Converts the df entries to the specified order of magnitude
+ forge.specialPlots.dospecialPlots - These function plots you all measurements, in the desired special plot style
